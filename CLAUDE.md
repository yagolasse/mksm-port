# mksm_recomp

Native Windows port of Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks (original Xbox, title ID 4D570029) built by
statically recompiling the retail `default.xbe` to C with
[xboxrecomp](https://github.com/sp00nznet/xboxrecomp). Users supply their own game disc.

**This repo is intended to become public.** Keep it free of copyrighted or game-derived material.

## Hard rules
- Never commit game data: `.xbe`, `.iso`, extracted assets, WAD contents, movies, shaders from the disc.
- Never commit `src/recomp/gen/`. It's generated from the game binary (gitignored).
- Don't paste disassembly or decompiled game code into this repo. Hand-written reimplementations
  and overrides in `src/` are fine.
- Private research notes belong in the separate `../docs` repo, not here.

## Layout
- `CMakeLists.txt`: game executable `mksm_recomp`; pulls in the toolkit via `add_subdirectory`
- `src/main.c`: host entry: loads the XBE, maps Xbox memory, inits kernel/bridge, calls the guest entry `0x000F40CA`
- `src/recomp_manual.c`: hand-written overrides (`recomp_lookup_manual`) and ICALL diagnostics
- `src/recomp/gen/`: generated C (not in git)
- `external/xboxrecomp/`: toolkit git submodule (pinned). Prefer fixing things in our `src/` first;
  toolkit changes should go upstream or into a fork
- `tools/xiso.py`: list/extract files from an Xbox disc image

## Pipeline (run from `external/xboxrecomp`, game data in `../../../game_files`)
```bash
python -m tools.xbe_parser ../../../game_files/default.xbe --json ../../../game_files/default_analysis.json
python -m tools.disasm ../../../game_files/default.xbe -v          # all code sections, NOT --text-only
python -m tools.func_id ../../../game_files/default.xbe -v
python -m tools.abi_analysis ../../../game_files/default.xbe -v
bash ../../tools/ghidra/run_ghidra.sh   # our wrapper (Java export; Ghidra 12 has no Jython), ~20+ min
python tools/ghidra_naming/merge_names.py --apply
python -m tools.recomp ../../../game_files/default.xbe --all --split 250 --gen-dir ../../src/recomp/gen
```
- Use all code sections. The game calls directly into its statically linked D3D/DSOUND/D3DX/WMADEC/XPP/
  PSFD00 (Sofdec)/DOLBY sections.
- Tool outputs land in `external/xboxrecomp/tools/*/output/` (gitignored there).

## Build
VS 2022 + CMake, x64 (the default; don't force `-A Win32`).
```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release --parallel 6
```
Use `--parallel N`, not `-- /m`: Git Bash rewrites `/m` into a path (`M:/`) and MSBuild fails.
At runtime the exe reads `game\default.xbe` and game data from `game\` relative to the working
directory (`YOUR_GAME_XBE_PATH` / `YOUR_GAME_DIR` in `src/main.c`).

## Debugging
Expect crashes during bring-up. The VEH handler in `main.c` prints the faulting guest function, the
guest stack, and recent ICALL targets. Fix by adding overrides in `recomp_manual.c` or runtime
support. Useful env vars from the toolkit: `RECOMP_WATCHDOG_SECS`, `RECOMP_AC97_READY`.
